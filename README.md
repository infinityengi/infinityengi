## 🚀 Projects

- [**Visual Lane Following Robot (ACDC)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/visual-lane-following-robot-acdc)  
  ROS-based system on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for detecting lanes and generating steering commands using Pure Pursuit, integrated with simulation and real-world tests.

- [**Lane Detection Using K-Means Clustering**](https://github.com/infinityengi/Lane-Detection-Using-K-Means-Clustering)  
  Python + OpenCV pipeline for detecting yellow lane lines on complex road backgrounds using K-Means color clustering and polynomial fitting.

- [**Inverse Perspective Mapping (C++)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/inverse-perspective-mapping-cpp)  
  Real-time road view transformation in C++ with OpenCV for lane geometry extraction and perspective correction.

- [**Curved Lane Detection (Sliding Window)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/curved-lane-detection-sliding-window)  
  Implements a histogram + sliding window method to detect and fit curved lane lines, tested with varying road curvature and lighting.

<!-- - [**Battery Modeling Toolkit**](https://github.com/yourusername/ev-battery-modeling)  
  MATLAB/Python toolkit for simulating Li-ion battery electro-thermal behavior, degradation, and cycle life prediction for EV applications.-->
