  ## üöÄ Projects

- [**Visual Lane Following Robot (ACDC)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/visual-lane-following-robot-acdc)  
  ROS-based system on NVIDIA Jetson Nano for detecting lanes and generating steering commands using Pure Pursuit, integrated with simulation and real-world tests.

- [**Lane Detection Using K-Means Clustering**](https://github.com/infinityengi/Lane-Detection-Using-K-Means-Clustering)  
  Python + OpenCV pipeline for detecting yellow lane lines on complex road backgrounds using K-Means color clustering and polynomial fitting.

- [**Inverse Perspective Mapping (C++)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/inverse-perspective-mapping-cpp)  
  Real-time road view transformation in C++ with OpenCV for lane geometry extraction and perspective correction.

- [**Curved Lane Detection (Sliding Window)**](https://github.com/infinityengi/curved-lane-detection-sliding-window)  
  Implements a histogram + sliding window method to detect and fit curved lane lines, tested with varying road curvature and lighting.

- [**V-Model Automotive Portfolio**](https://github.com/infinityengi/v-model-automotive-portfolio)  
  A systems-engineering toolkit showcasing V-Model workflows in automotive contexts (ISO 26262, AUTOSAR, HIL/SIL), with case studies like Lane-Keep-Assist mapped to each V-Model phase.

- [**Professional Workflow Notes**](https://github.com/infinityengi/professional-workflownotes)  
  A repeatable workflow guide from ideation to delivery with templates, diagrams, pseudocode drafting, and AI-assisted methods for engineering documentation.

- [**ACDC Practical Exercises**](https://github.com/infinityengi/acdc-practical-exercises)  
  Study notes and hands-on exercises from the ACDC MOOC covering perception, mapping, fusion, planning, and connected driving, organized into modular Jupyter notebooks.

- [**ADAS Hands-On Repo**](https://github.com/infinityengi/ADAS-HandsOn-Repo)  
  Hands-on ADAS and autonomous mobility skeleton repo with concise notes, reproducible notebooks, and mini-projects (ACC, AEB, LKA) built for CI-friendly development.

  <!-- - [**Battery Modeling Toolkit**](https://github.com/yourusername/ev-battery-modeling)  
  MATLAB/Python toolkit for simulating Li-ion battery electro-thermal behavior, degradation, and cycle life prediction for EV applications.-->
